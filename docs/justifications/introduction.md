# Introduction

This document provides rationale and justifications for the requirements
specified in the SpdxTool Requirements Specification. Each justification
explains the reasoning behind a requirement, including business needs,
technical constraints, regulatory considerations, and user expectations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- Provide transparent reasoning for each requirement
- Support requirement review and validation processes
- Facilitate informed decision-making during requirement changes
- Document assumptions and constraints that influenced requirement definition
- Ensure stakeholder alignment on requirement priorities and rationale

By documenting justifications, this specification enables better understanding
of why each requirement exists and supports more effective requirement
management throughout the project lifecycle.

## Scope

This justifications document covers the same functional areas as the
requirements specification:

- **CLI Commands**: Rationale for command-line interface design decisions
- **Validation**: Justification for validation rules and standards compliance
- **Package Management**: Reasoning behind package operation requirements
- **Relationships**: Rationale for relationship management capabilities
- **Workflow Support**: Justification for automation and integration features
- **Platform Support**: Reasoning for cross-platform compatibility choices
- **File Format Support**: Justification for supported SPDX format decisions
- **Error Handling**: Rationale for error handling and user feedback approaches

Each justification is linked to its corresponding requirement identifier,
maintaining clear traceability between requirements and their rationale.

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- **Requirements Engineers**: Understanding requirement origins and rationale
- **Software Architects**: Making design decisions aligned with requirement intent
- **Project Stakeholders**: Evaluating requirement priorities and trade-offs
- **Quality Assurance**: Validating that implementations satisfy intended purposes
- **Product Managers**: Making informed decisions about requirement changes
- **Auditors**: Verifying that requirements are properly justified and traceable
